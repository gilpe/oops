## :pickup_truck: Description

The game is about a delivery van from the low-cost courier company **OOPS**, known for its somewhat rundown fleet, poorly packaged fragile goods, and tight delivery schedules.

OOPS has recently secured new deliveries to luxury suburban neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city. Its drivers must put their driving skills to the test to deliver as much intact cargo as posible while keeping the neighborhood as clean as they can.

## :gear: Main systems and mechanics

### The truck

#### Driving

The vehicle features the classic mechanics of a driving system: acceleration, reverse gear, front-axle steering, braking and suspensión on all four wheels, and a handbrake.

However, these components are slightly defective and worn out after years of use and poor maintenance, so driving performance is affected by their condition.

#### Cargo capacity

The chassis is a pickup type and includes a rectangular rear cargo bed where the goods are placed.

### The road

#### Start and finish

The track includes a starting point where the van appears spontaneously with a new load of goods, and a finish line where the vehicle automatically stops.

#### Route

The route covers the area between the start and finish points. It is one-way, flanked by buildings, and offers no possible detours, so leaving the course is not an option.

Although the road is paved and well-maintained, its topography is whimsical, featuring slopes and sharp turns.

### The cargo

Products are loaded into the van when it appears at the starting point.

Each load contains several units of the same type of product, and the number of items depends on how many can fit in the cargo bed according to their volume.

Each product type has its own level of resistance to impacts, enduring more or less depending on its shape, weight, and hardness.

The number of intact items is always visible during the journey and updates as products are lost.
